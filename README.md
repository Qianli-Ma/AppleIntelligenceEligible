### Manual Execution

#### Method 1 (Recommended)

Need one time SIP disable during the script.

1. Disable SIP in recovery mode with `csrutil disable`
2. Add boot argument by `sudo nvram boot-args="amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"` and reboot
3. Download `eligibility_util` from the [release page](https://github.com/Kyle-Ye/XcodeLLMEligible/releases) and execute `./eligibility_util forceDomainAnswer --domain-name OS_ELIGIBILITY_DOMAIN_XCODE_LLM --answer 4`
4. Execute `./eligibility_util forceDomainAnswer --domain-name OS_ELIGIBILITY_DOMAIN_GREYMATTER --answer 4`
5. Enable SIP in recovery mode with `csrutil enable` and reboot.
6. Remove boot argument by `sudo nvram -d boot-args`

> Read [Disabling and Enabling System Integrity Protection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection) if you are unfamiliar with SIP operation.
>
> You can only set boot-args in recovery mode or normal mode with SIP disabled.

No SIP disabled needed in total.

1. Download `eligibility_overrides.data` file from the [release page](https://github.com/Kyle-Ye/XcodeLLMEligible/releases)
2. Find the correct container path for `eligibilityd` under `~/Library/Daemon Containers/<UUID>`
3. Move the downloaded file to `eligibilityd`'s daemon container's `Data/Library/Caches/NeverRestore/` folder. If you are not sure which one is for `eligibilityd`, you can try it one by one or just add the file to all of the containers.
